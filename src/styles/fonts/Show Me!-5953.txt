One more thing! 

If you have created something nice I invite you to show me. I collect users creations to make a "Fonts In Use" gallery on my website. Visitors will be able to see what you've designed and at the same time that can help me to grow.

You can send me your images by email: godefroidremi@gmail.com

By sending me your image you accept that I show it on my website. You can ask anytime to remove it from the gallery.

Thanks a lot!
